# Hybrid VTOL UAV Development

### 🎯 Aim
To design and implement a **hybrid VTOL airframe** capable of high-stability transitions between vertical hover and horizontal forward flight modes.

### 🛠️ Key Technical Phases
*   **Aerodynamic Analysis:** Conducted extensive wing profile optimization and stability prediction using **Xflr5** to ensure efficient fixed-wing performance.
*   **Structural Modeling:** Designed all key airframe components in **Fusion 360**, ensuring high-precision fit for fabrication.
*   **Flight Control & Stability:** Configured and tuned **PID control loops** within **Mission Planner** to facilitate reliable, smooth mode-switching.

### 🚀 Results
*   Achieved a fully functional transition logic with validated aerodynamic stability.
*   Minimized oscillation during the critical hover-to-forward flight phase.
