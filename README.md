# Hybrid VTOL UAV Development (In-Progress 🚀)

### 🎯 Project Aim
To design and develop a **hybrid VTOL airframe** capable of high-stability transitions between vertical hover and horizontal forward flight modes.

### 🛠️ Current Development Phases
*   **Aerodynamic Analysis:** Optimizing wing profiles and predicting performance using **Xflr5** to ensure efficient fixed-wing stability.
*   **Structural Modeling:** Designing high-precision airframe components in **Fusion 360** for upcoming fabrication.
*   **Flight Control System:** Configuring **PID control loops** within **Mission Planner** to facilitate reliable, smooth mode-switching.

### 📈 Current Project Status
- [x] Initial aerodynamic wing profiling (Xflr5)
- [x] 3D Structural modeling of key components (Fusion 360)
- [/] PID tuning and transition logic configuration (Mission Planner)
- [ ] Physical fabrication and flight testing (Planned)

### 🚀 Goal
To achieve a fully functional, flight-ready VTOL prototype with validated aerodynamic performance and seamless mode transitions.
